# Shellclave 

Attach to relevant processes, prevent malicious activity and grade if we allow their execution. 

In theory this can make the process think it did something by modifying the return value of the syscall. 

Currently this is just a CLI tool for debugging the ptrace seccomp flow. 

Maybe someday...
